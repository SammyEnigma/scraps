Running Tests
==

Tests currently rely on [CI Tacklebox](https://github.com/bittorrent/ci-tacklebox/). The master branch *usually* works the heads of the branches here. If you're building an older commit, may God have mercy on your soul.

If you've installed the right version, the scripts in *scripts/ci-tacklebox* might work for you.
